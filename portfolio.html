									<h1>2nd Truth Zine</h1>
									<h2>Publication · November 2019</h2>
								</hgroup>
								<p>This booklet documents the story and code of an assembly raytracer, arguably the simplest and purest digital method of projecting 3D information into 2D.</p>
								<p>The base design was inspired by old computer punchcards, and the yellow pop-ups from tabloid and computer ads— which representic the organic limitations of human vision as opposed to the the pure mathematical nature of the tracer.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="paragraph-group">
								<p>Throughout the zine the ads are “infecting” the raytracer with eye abberations and chemicals (like cataracts and rhodopsin), slowing it from finding the “truth” referenced in the title.</p>
								<p>On the last page, the raytracer cannot continue ‘getting closer to the truth’ and crashes into the viewer (like a computer program would).</p>

								<p>Custom Georgian clothing graphic requested and gifted to English music producer Adam Freeland after his biking trip in Mestia, Georgia.</p>

								<p>The design was linocut and printed on masa paper, originally with inverted colors. The type was specially designed for this graphic, incorporating 1970s Georgian hand-painted signage with English blackletter.</p>

								<p>This poster is about my upbringing with Orthodox Christianity in Georgia. Many people I grew up with were only passively religious, and wore labels like “Christian” and “Masculine” to gain respect from their peers. Often I was brought into social situations where I’d have to prove my “brotherhood” to others, but it felt more like fitting into a prepackaged character.</p>
								<p>By dressing up the stereotypical Marlboro cover in Orthodox frames, mixed with 70s–80s Georgian gun/shell packaging I hope to bring these two pressures into one image.</p>
