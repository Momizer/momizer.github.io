			<h1>What is Basalt?</h1>
			<p>Basalt (composed of the minerals plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine) is the generic term for solidified volcanic lava.  Similar to carbon fibre and fibreglass it has better physicomechanical properties than fibreglass but is significantly cheaper than carbon fibre. Being a mafic extrusive rock, it is the most widespread of all ingenous rocks and comprises more than 90% of all volcanic rocks.</p>
			<h2>Basalt Fibre Production Process</h2>
			<p>Basalt fibre is simply crushed basalt, washed and melted at about 1,500 Degrees C (2,730 degrees F) and then fed through small nozzles to produce continuous filaments.  Basalt   fibres are 100% natural and inert and have, in addition, been tested and proven to be <em>non-carcinogenic</em> and <em>non-toxic.</em></p>
			<p>BF is also incredibly durable, immune to nuclear radiation, UV light, biological and fungal contamination.  The fibres can withstand extremely high temperatures and are stronger and more stable than alternative mineral and glass fibres.  Their tenacity exceeds steel fibres many times over.</p>
			<p>Known as ‘the green industrial material of the XXI-century” BF combines ecological safety, natural longevity and many other properties.  It has gained increasing attention as a new reinforcing material, requiring <em>less energy</em> in the production of glass fibre & similar bi-products.  It is therefore less expensive than its traditional counterparts.</p>
			<h2>Market Demand</h2>
			<p>The basalt fibre market is projected to grow from USD 227 million in 2019 to USD 397 million by 2024, at a compound annual growth rate of 11.8% between 2019 and 2024. The demand from construction & infrastructure, automotive & transportation, and electrical & electronics industries is exponential.</p>
			<p>Basalt fibre is finding increased application in the construction & infrastructure segment due to its high strength and non-corrosive properties. In particular it is attractive due to its environmentally friendly properties, good compatibility with concrete, and easy mixing at high concentration. Basalt fiber also offers higher mechanical strength that is required for construction in extreme conditions. These are available at a much lower price compared to all other alkali-resistant fibres.</p>
			<h2>Opportunity: Growing adoption of environmentally friendly and recyclable material</h2>
			<p>Stringent demands on industry to provide environmentally friendly products instead of petroleum-based products will ensure that natural fibre composites such as basalt fibre will thrive in the near future.  With inexhaustible supplies it is seen as one of the most exciting new materials with the technological developments of this century. Europe’s increasing use of bio-based materials, encouraging recyclability of vehicle components, the Japanese Government has a target of replacing 20% of plastic usage by renewable products by 2020 and other regulations will ensure its future.</p>

			<h3>Rebar</h3>
			<i>Construction</i>
			<p>Basalt rock is heated to a molten stage and formed into the fibres which are then mixed with epoxy resins and moulded into the rebar using pultrusion technology.  The surface is then profiled and sanded.</p>
			<i>Application</i>
			<p>Basalt Rebars are an outstanding product for concrete reinforcement weighing 4 times less than steel but with its tensile strength being 3 times higher. The are widely used in the construction of highways, bridges, airports, terminals, stations and underground engineering.</p>


			<h3>Rebar Mesh</h3>
			<p class="subtext">(Brochure states 4mm-25mm diameter)</p>
			<i>Construction</i>
			<p>Mainly for construction this mesh is made of basalt roving with acrylic impregnation and polyester threat. It is a reinforcement textile, a biaxial mesh woven from multifilament yarns.</p>
			<i>Application</i>
			<p>Basalt mesh is used in masonry works, reinforcing of plaster layers, such as floors in living areas, the construction of roads, hydraulic structures and aerodromes.  Due to its Its strength and low thermal conductivity enabling it to withstand temperature changes in aggressive environments it is an ideal product for seismic areas.</p>

			<h3>Chopped Fibres</h3>

			<p class="subtext">(Brochure states: two types - turbo-build dipspergate and turbo-build integral)</p>

			<i>Construction</i>
			Basalt fibre is made from molten washed and crushed basalt rock that is then extruded through small nozzles to produce continuous filaments of basalt fiber. The fibers 
			typically have a filament diameter of between 9 and 13 micron. They also have a high elastic modulus, resulting in excellent specific strength—three times that of steel. As a naturally occurring material, basalt fibre is inherently more recyclable than other reinforcing fibres a factor that industry is increasingly taking into consideration.

			Application
			Insulation, as a fireproof textile such as fireproof barriers or fire-retardent material and a composite product.  As an example basalt chopped fibres can be mixed directly into polymers and concrete to increase tensile strength and reduce cracking and chipping.  The fibres are used in the production of most other basalt related manufacturing products.

			<h3>Geogrid</h3>

			(Brochure states: with tensile strength ranging from 20 kN/m to 600 kN/m)

			<i>Construction</i>
			Geogrid is a construction mesh made of basalt roving with acrylic impregnation and polyester thread. 

			Application
			Geogrid is designed for reinforcing road surfaces.  It is successfully used in construction, repair and the reconstruction of roads as a reinforcing layer removing internal stress on the asphalt-concrete coating.  It can also be used to increase the strength of the finishing layer of asphalt so as not to break (particularly relevant in hot countries).  

			<h3>Strip</h3>
			<i>Construction</i>
			Basalt lava stone strips are made by sawing them into slabs, strips, paving or multi-functional tiling.  Mono/multi diamond-disc saw machinery is used along with computerized cross-cutting machines.

			Application
			Ideal for building terraces and cladding facades.


			<h3>Mat</h3>

			Basalt fiber tape is made from basalt roving or textured fibre and can be woven to varying thicknesses and weaves. Basalt mat is safe, inert, non-respirable, chemical resistant, acid resistant and water resistant.  It is also particularly good for sound absorption and can be stretched or compressed to influence not only the width but also the fibre angle.

			Basalt fibre mat is particularly good for sound absorption and high heat insultation.
