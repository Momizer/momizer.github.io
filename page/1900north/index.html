			<p class="intro">â€¦after more than <em>three decades</em> of cleaning experience, we look at carpet cleaning from a unique perspective. Not only do we love cleaning carpets, but we love cleaning to the best of our abilities.</p>
			<p class="intro"><b>Every day. Every job. <wbr><span class="fresh no-wrap">It's in our <i>DNA</i>.</span></b></p>
			<section class="subtext">
				<p>We'll never be the company that rushes in, rushes through cleaning and rushes off. Our goal has always been to offer exceptional cleaning, great service, and attention to details.</p>
				<p>And, as we take care of every item we clean, we likewise pay attention to everything we don't cleanâ€”walls, furniture, flooring, decorâ€”making sure we leave the items that make your house a <i>home</i>, just as we found them.</p>
				<p>When you schedule with <i>1900 North</i>, you're guaranteed a pleasant, smiling, clean-cut technician with years of cleaning experience at your front door. Someone who will listen to your needs and strive to meet them.</p>
				<p><em>Imagine how refreshing that could be?</em></p>
