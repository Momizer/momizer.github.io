			<h2>Do you just clean homes?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Our main focus is on residential cleaning.  As the previous owner of <i>Swan’s Carpet Cleaning</i>, The <i>Oriental Rug Washing Company</i> and <i>Benchmark Carpet Cleaning</i>, we’ve cleaned many thousands of residences over the years in Utah and Salt Lake County.</p>
			
			<h2>Can you clean commercial accounts?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Absolutely.  Below are many of the companies we’ve cleaned for:</p>
			<ul class="subtext columns">
				<li>United Way</li>
				<li>Marriott</li>
				<li>Westco</li>
				<li>Magleby Construction</li>
				<li>Riverside Country Club</li>
				<li>Alexanders Print Advantage</li>
				<li>Qualtry</li>
				<li>Influence International</li>
				<li>Title West</li>
				<li>Mike Klauck Construction</li>
				<li>Redstone Residential</li>
				<li>Brereton Automotive</li>
				<li>Brookside Professional Center</li>
				<li>Jimmy’s Love Bug</li>
				<li>Larson and Company</li>
				<li>McEwan Custom Homes</li>
				<li>Watts Enterprises</li>
				<li>Robison Construction</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>How do you charge for cleaning, by the square foot or by room?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> We charge by the square foot, and only the areas we actually clean. For example, in a bedroom where we wouldn’t be cleaning under the bed, we don’t charge you for the area under the bed. And if cleaning takes longer than we thought it might, our time doesn’t cost you anything but the original square foot price.</p>

			<h2>Do I need to be home while you clean?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> No, and you may be far happier being someplace else enjoying some peace and quiet! If you’re comfortable with us in your home, we’re comfortable cleaning by ourselves.</p>
			<p>Two caveats. If you have pets, they need to be put somewhere safe and comfortable for the duration of the cleaning for their safety and ours. And children under the age of 21 should not be left alone in the house without parental supervision.</p>

			<h2>Do you use fans to help cleaned areas dry quickly?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> We do!  And we’re happy to leave fans with you overnight if you’d like, at no additional cost.</p>
			
			<h2>We have carpet and tile and grout that needs to be cleaned.  Can you do both on the same day?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Yes, assuming the amount of areas to be cleaned can generally be completed in an 8-hour day.</p>

			<h2>Can you remove every spot or spill?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Wouldn’t that be grand?! The short answer is no. However, with the full complement of spotting agents we carry and expertise learned over the years, we can probably remove about 99% of your spots and spills.</p>
			
			<h2>What should we do with all of our furniture?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> We can clean around furniture that’s impractical to move such as pianos, curios, sectional couches, beds and bedroom furniture. We invite the homeowner to remove all small items from the floor before we arrive. If you would like us to clean under couches, loveseats etc. we can often slide them out of the way, clean, and then slide them back into position and put waterproof blocks or tab under their legs or feet.</p>
			
			<h2>Should I try removing a spot before you come?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Excellent question!  Let us be completely clear on this. <i>Maybe.</i></p>
			<p><b>A:</b> Inks, dyes, paint, oils, glue, rust, tar or mystery spots? Call us before you try anything. Mud, food spills, puppy accidents, general soiling can often be cleaned up well by the homeowner. When in doubt, you’re always welcome to call for advice.</p>
			
			<h2>Do you offer flood or fire restoration?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> No, but we’ll be happy to suggest companies that can help.</p>
			
			<h2>Do fabric protectors such as 3M Scotchgard or DuPont Teflon really work?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Yes!  They’re not perfect, but good quality protectors for carpet and upholstery can give you the extra moments to clean up a small spot or spill before it becomes a large spot or spill. Well protected carpet and upholstery is always easier to clean than the same items without protector.</p>
			<p>There are lots of variables in fabric protection—we’ll share with you the pros and cons for your particular situation.</p>
			
			<h2>Can you remove puppy urine from carpet?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Yes.  Can we guarantee complete removal? No. Can we remove much of the urine and make the area involved a more pleasant place to be? Yes.</p>
			
			<h2>Do you clean on weekends?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Occasionally on Saturdays (if you twist our arms), but we prefer weekdays.</p>
			
			<h2>What forms of payment do you accept?</h2>
			<p><b>A:</b> Checks, Cash, Venmo, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express.</p>
