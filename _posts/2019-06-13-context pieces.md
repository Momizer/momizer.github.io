# Something Something "Context Pieces"

Writing about this in retrospect because the last time I've come across this idea I only left myself a few notes. Pretty weird and soulless to do but let's try to put something into it. Started June 13 finished June 28.

There's a movie out there where a mother cleans her house for a few hours. I wouldn't know for sure though, I haven't been able to find anything about the movie since I first saw a bit of it in passing. Despite that, it's said about the film that halfway throughout a spoon falling is a major plot point, and I wanted to ruminate on this phenomenon.

The idea of "context pieces" as it's easiest to refer to connects to the larger idea of the accesibility of art and how everything is experienced by people. (_"wow!"_ huh?) Sounds so fucking pretentious! But really I would just like for there to be a way for people to be able to experience art in some universal way. I enjoy to casually ask the question of artist intention vs. the subjective meaning that the audience gets from something often to myself and others, but I'm coming to understand that it's a very hard question to answer!

In fact I know so little that I can only _feel_ as though context pieces come closest to dead neutral on the intention/subjective scale, and so define them as such as well; However, the idea is markedly maleable. All this, fortunately, makes the idea very universal! All art is made by an artist in one form or another, and the divided issue stems directly from the audience's existence. Thus, by context pieces inherintely removing the stereotypical marks of an artist's 'hand' slowly erase the art's sense of creation.

I love context pieces and hope to create many of them. Meta work has a great place in my heart and it speaks to my core of understanding and playing with the limitations of mediums.

In a way idea accompanies the admiration of art that is wholistically beautiful pretty well. Several other entire cultures hold this idea on a much higher pedestal that the western world does, but that makes me love it that much more.
