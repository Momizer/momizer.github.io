	- No one knows what this is a part of, most likely an open secret religion that was intentionally not recorded.

	- Floor plan looked like a church by accident, happy accident

![](/assets/images/hagia_sophia-3.jpg)
	- Don't even notice the windows because they are surrounded by decoration
	- Dome at the top looks like "it's being hung from a chain from heaven"
	- Decoration is extremely intense, carved *underneath* the marble on pillars, would have to have hooked knives to do it.
		- Looks like it's floating, pillars are meant to deny the material it's made of.
		- *Why?* Using light/lightness to denote the prescense of the spirit, divinity. The church has to be made of material, but the construction of it goes against it.

		![](/assets/images/hagia_sophia-5.jpg)
- San Vitale (detail: apse mosaic; detail: Justinian), 528-547, Justinian, Ravenna, Italy
	- Church made to commemorate a single person, built specifically. Saint Vitalus.
	- #### Mosaic
		- Christ sitting on the orb of the universe. Includes crown given to martyrs, people who die for their faith.
		- Showing church being given to christ.
		- Christ is wearing cloak that is reserved for the emporer.
		- Seven seals scroll represents the end of the world
		- Rivers of living water underneath figures
		- Rainbow "of the apocalypse" above christ
		- Christ shown clean shaven and short hair, is always meant to be a stand in for the context. Is meant to be a stand-in for the king-of-kings.
	- #### Second Mosaic
		- *Purposefully not naturalistic* because if it was it would imply that it is happening in front of the viewer, things of divinity are too sacred to depict in that way.
- San Apollinaire in Classe, (mosaic: Transfiguration), 6th C., mosaic, Ravenna, Italy
	- Associating bible transfiguration with decoration in front you, *you* are a part of the transfiguration
		- Medieval art is never just for decoration, it's menat to expand the ritual that is happening.
		- What's happening is that all of the people are the sheep, takes imagery from the past and present and creates a complex theological argument.
		- Halos start coming in, history of which is complex. Origianlly meant for emporers but apporpriated for religious divine importance.
- Christ Pantokrator, 6th C., encaustic on panel, St. Catherine's Monastery, Sinai, Egypt
	- Worshiping the object? Or the god? Huge argument currently, basically a tool for worhship of the real thing.
		- Ancient stories of praying to object, and painting looking at person and nodding. Many Christians get angry at this because it's too object-oriented.
	- Lazy eye due to half-and-half of being divine or human argument.

## Migrational, Hiberno-Saxon & Viking Art
More abstract because it fits the needs of having to carry the items around.
- Book of Kells, (Chi-Rho, Matthew), 8th C., manuscript, Trinity Library, Dublin
	- Scrolls became inconvenient to read because finding information was hard (jumping from start to end)
	![](/assets/images/kells-1.jpg)
	- "Codex" format was invented, folios were cut up and binded – creating the modern book.
	![](/assets/images/kells-2.jpg)
		- Bible was written in this format. Idea of reading for yourself was a foreign concept, scrolls were to help along with oral culture. Christianity moved this idea to reading to yourself.
		- Current letter size is almost exactly ¼<sup>th</sup> the hide of a sheep.
		- Bigger books used one sheep per page, a hundred sheep per book. Which is why they're extremely decorated and very good gifts. Kings often couldn't read it, so decoration was used to show it's value.

- Sutton Hoo Ship Burial (buckle, helmet), 7th C., Gold, British Museum, London
![](/assets/images/sutton_hoo_burial-1.jpg)
	- Amazing teasure trove, under barrow that had disintegrated.
	![](/assets/images/sutton_hoo_burial-2.jpg)
		- Found Great Golden Buckle, Germanic patterns (celtic-looking, celtics appropriated it)
		![](/assets/images/sutton_hoo_burial_belt.jpg)
		- Decorated this way, theorized to be a love of surface decoration. Needs a lot of skill to make, and to keep track of animals going in and out.
		- Helmet is also decorated with animals.

- Oseberg Ship Burial (ship & wagon) 9th C., Wood, Oseberg, Norway

![](/assets/images/oseberg_wagon-1.jpg)
![](/assets/images/oseberg_wagon-2.jpg)
- Jelling Stone (King Harald Bluetooth), c. 960, stone,  Jelling, Dennmark
	- Shows Jesus in viking's medium, he takes on the decoration.
	- Shows how cool Jesus was compared to other gods.

## Carolingian & Ottonian
- Palatine Chapel, 792-805, Aachen, Germany
- Coronation Gospels, c. 800 Palace School, manuscript, Kunsthistoriches Museum, Vienna
- Doors of St. Michael's, c. 1020, Bishop Bernward, bronze, Hildesheim, Germany
- Gospel Book of Otto III, c. 1000, manuscript, Staatsbibliothek, Munich

## Romanesque
- Artifacts held inside reliqueries.
	- Hugely valued in Christianity, so much so that people would steal these relics constantly for protection
	- Market for false relics was born. 
		- There are no less than 3 heads of John the Baptist
		- Mark Twain said that there are enough shards of the cross of christ to build a cathedral.
- Toulouse, 1060-1119, France (nave, elevation & plan)
	- International style for churches began to develop because of religious tourists and traders spreading knowledge
	- Stonework wasn't finished because they ran out of money
	- Church has a massive nave barrel vaults that towers over you
		- Tall first floor draws the eyes up, no practical reason to be this tall but helps make the building very wide and gives a sense of soaring height.
		- Invented ambulatory (:to walk) (top circular part) to help with the flow of traffic
		- Ambulatory lights, added into new apses that were allowed due to sheer size. Creates a fractal like effect from the outside.
	- All communities along religious trading paths built extremely large churches no matter how small, because of how many pilgrims there were.
		- Every amusement park is in Orlando because of Disneyland.
- Foy, Conques, 1050-1120, France (west portal, Maiestas Domini, Judgment Scene)
	- played around with a lot of sculpture, relevant sided stories on each side of the cathedral. Also borrowed unrelated greek stories.
- Cluny III 1088-1450, France (nave, elevation & plan)
	- Real economic powerhouses, produced goods for the monastery.
	- Cluny III was the largest religious building ever built at this point.
		- Vast interior spaces, 440ft. At the crossing tower it was over 120ft, as tall as a 9 story building.
		- Brings together all the features of the romanesque, latin cross, barrel vault, has two transepts.
		- Features the pointed arch, engineering solution to support such large arches and reduce width of butresses and walls
		- Medieval buildings were built organically, never planned all-out before hand. Not built bottom-up like today, but from front-to-back.
			- Nothing is ever the same length, Notre Dame cathedral is a curved banana, but it fit the needs.
			- Often buildings are left unfinished because of unsolved problems
			- Buildings built on top of buildings, the function was perserved regardless of building progress.
		- 
	- Without the reliquery trade and the interest in pilgrimage none of these cathedrals would exist.
- Durham Cathedral, 1093-1133, England (Interior & cross-section)

## Early & High Gothic
- Stained glass windows coming into fashion, totally different than what came before
	- Many of which were unreadable, not made for an audience but for god.
		- Started to change over time, started making statues and figures largers as they went on.
		- Some of the greatest pieces of art were made to be intentionally buried.
- Denis, 1140-1144, France (chevet, stained glass, Abbot Suger)
- Notre Dame, 1163-1250, Paris, France (façade, nave, elevation & plan)
	- Using pointed arch no longer just as an engineering need, but as an aesthetic choice.
	- Flying butresses are used to support the wall to allow the entire inner wall to be made of glass, giant windows.
	- Pointed arches can thin and expand like scissors, whereas normal arches *have* to intersect.
