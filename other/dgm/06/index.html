			Hello! Welcome to my blog! This is a resource for you to use, <i>per</i>use, and enjoy. I made it so you can find cool information about the techniques used to program your favorite games, or just cool programming things in general. Gaming has a lot of things that go undocumented, but this website exists to find and list it all here. Hopefully people can use this resource in aid of their own games and creations.

		<h2>Resources, for you?</h2>
		<p>
			That's right, all of this is collected by me, for your viewing pleasure! If one person does the work, it saves a lot of other people doing the same thing.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Free information</h2>
		<p>
			I believe in free information. Paywalls are difficult things, so advocating for that which is free is important for making information realisitically available for future generations.

		<blockquote>
			We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem," he said. "If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate's service is more valuable.
