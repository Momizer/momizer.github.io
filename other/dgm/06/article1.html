		<h3 id="controller">Controller Smoothing</h3>
		<p> 
			You'll want to smooth out the controller's input using various algorithms (<a href="#source2">see source 2</a>), as many controller's inputs are not reliable. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Bennet Foddy had a segment at a GDC talk where he talked about how heavy objects compensated for overshooting their desired direction using a "PID". This counter-steering controller generally has three tuneable variables that have no perfect value and thus must be tuned by the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			Can be used for tuneable turrent control. The player can/must set their own values for how their weapon responds to input and it's way of compensating for its own weight. Adds to player attachment with weapons and allows for min-maxing according to their specific situation.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="analog">Interpreting Analog Stick Input</h3>
		<p>
			When interpreting input from an analog stick, there are five main things to keep track of:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Position of stick</li>
			<li>Inner deadzone</li>
			<li>Outer rim deadzone</li>
			<li>Circular bound</li>
			<li>Custom function interpretation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		
		
		<h3 id="mood">Mood Prototyping</h3>
		<p>
			&bull; <b>You may ask yourself:</b> How do you prototype a <i>mood?</i>
			<br>It's not tangible, it's not physical&mdash; most importantly, it's fleeting.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="feeling">Reaching for a "Feeling"</h3>
		<p>
			Understand what you're aiming for and create mood boards early on in the project, it will help keep your team focused on a central vision.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			It all came together pretty well but we wish we could have known all of this info sooner rather than later.
